### File Structure
```
chrome-extension/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json          # Extension configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.html            # Extension popup UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.js              # Popup logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.js            # Content script for job extraction

### Key Components

- **Content Script**: Extracts job data from web pages
- **Popup**: User interface for adding jobs
- **Background**: Handles extension lifecycle and communication
- **API Integration**: Communicates with your Job Tracker backend

## API Integration

The extension communicates with your Job Tracker API using the following endpoint:

```
POST /api/jobs
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Software Engineer",
  "company": "Tech Corp",
  "link": "https://...",
  "status": "applied",
  "date_applied": "2024-01-15",
  "notes": "Job description...",
  "tags": ["react", "frontend"]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not detecting jobs?
- Make sure you're on a job posting page
- Check that the extension has permission to access the site
- Try refreshing the page and clicking the extension icon again

### API connection issues?
- Verify your API URL is correct
- Check that your authentication token is valid
- Ensure your Job Tracker backend is running
- Check browser console for error messages

### Auto-fill not working?
- The extension tries to extract data from common job sites
- If auto-fill fails, you can still add jobs manually
- Some job sites may have different HTML structures
